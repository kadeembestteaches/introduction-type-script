//Explicit Variable Declaration 
let num1:number = 5;
num1 =5;
//num1="Spiderman 3"; I cannot do this!!! 

let age:number = 27;
let empName:string = "Jon Snow";
let isActive:boolean=false;


//Implicit Variable Declaration
let num2=5; //You are indeed assigning a data type to this variable!! 
//num2 = 'blah'; //this gave you an error because it already has a number data assigned!!! 


let age2=88;
let empName2="Ayra";

//empName2 = 25; //This will also give you an error. Because the data is already assigned!!! 

let isActive2=true;
